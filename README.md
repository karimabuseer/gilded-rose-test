# Gilded Rose Tech Test
## Usage
1. To install the project, clone the code to your local machine and navigate to its directory
2. To run tests:
````
npm test
````
3. 

## To-do
- Change if Statements to all work off distinct boolean methods

## Approach
- I immediately moved Shop and Item into two separate files, as is convention (as the file was quite confusing to look at)
- I then decided to start writing tests to ensure the code had 100% coverage, as I was weary of making changes to the code without good visibility on the effect of those changes.
- I started by writing simple tests to ensure that the item constructor was working correctly, before I started writing tests for the Shop class to ensure all expected behaviour was working correctly.

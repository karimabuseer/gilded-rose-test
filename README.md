# Gilded Rose Tech Test
## Usage

## To-do
- Find a way to measure test coverage
- Lint code
- Separate classes

## Approach
- I immediately moved Shop and Item into two separate files, as is convention (as the file was quite confusing to look at)
- I then decided to write tests to ensure the code had 100% coverage.
